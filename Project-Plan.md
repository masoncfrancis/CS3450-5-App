#Project Plan

##Summary

##Team Organization

We will be using Jira as our primary tool for organizing tasks that need to be done during a spring and tracking progress. For questions that come up, we will also create different channels within our Discord group to organize our communication with each other.

##Software Development Process

##Communication Policies

We will be having standup meetings every Monday and Wednesday at 6 p.m. on Discord unless additional meeting time is needed or someone becomes unavailable during those times. Although we will be primarily using Discord for communication, we will also be using Jira for time management, listing and assigning tasks that need to be done during sprints, and easy creation of burn-down charts.
