# Project Plan

## Summary

In this project we will be creating a website for a mock company called _Dan's Rentals_. It will be a website that allows the owner (Dan) to manage his customers and employees, as well as manage the company's service: renting cars. 

There will be 3 levels of access to running or using the website, the owner, the employees, and the customers. The owner may provide service to customers, pay employees, and promote customers to employee status (or in reverse, demote back to a customer). Employees may provide services to customers, while customers can only request services. 

Obvious data that must be kept track of in this website are user accounts, balances, and inventory (as well as their associated availability status).

## Team Organization

We will be using Jira as our primary tool for organizing tasks that need to be done during a spring and tracking progress. For questions that come up, we will also create different channels within our Discord group to organize our communication with each other.

## Software Development Process



## Communication Policies

We will be having standup meetings every Monday and Wednesday at 6 p.m. on Discord unless additional meeting time is needed or someone becomes unavailable during those times. Although we will be primarily using Discord for communication, we will also be using Jira for time management, listing and assigning tasks that need to be done during sprints, and easy creation of burn-down charts.
